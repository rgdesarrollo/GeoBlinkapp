# GeoBlinkapp
Test app

I have chosen this language for the project because it works better for me, the are other framework but it can get more complicated sometimes, this has been more simple for this type of project. This doesn't mean that I can't use another framework.  

I have use npm run dev on the server, too run the project, that it comes in the library of webpack.
